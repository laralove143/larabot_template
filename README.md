# ðŸ¤– larabot template

This is a template repository containing initial code for my Discord bots.

To get started, simply search `bot` and replace it with the bot name, then remove the bits of code you don't need.

Although the code itself is very opinionated, feel free to fork the project and adjust it however you wish.
